# 🧩 Reusable React Components

This repository contains a growing collection of reusable React components I've built during real-world projects. They are simple, functional, and easy to integrate. The goal is to save time and effort when building React apps — whether for personal use or professional work.

---

## 🚀 Usage

You can freely:

- ✅ Use these components in personal or commercial projects  
- ✅ Modify or extend them as needed  
- ❌ Don’t repackage or resell without changes

These components use basic React and may include Material UI or Tailwind CSS where relevant. You can just copy and paste the code into your project.

## 📁 Components Included

- UI Elements (Buttons, Cards, Loaders)
- Forms and Inputs
- Modals and Dialogs
- Data Display (Tables, Lists)
- Project-specific blocks like Employee Schedulers

More will be added as I build them.
